## OpenDFKI

OpenDFKI is a self-hosted platform for open source DFKI projects.
Everyone can create an account.

Most recent OpenDFKI projects can be found on the [git.opendfki.de](https://git.opendfki.de/) GitLab.
Here a selection of some ([public projects](https://git.opendfki.de/explore/projects/starred?visibility_level=20)):
- [DynaQ](https://git.opendfki.de/reuschling/dynaq) - "Dynamic Queries for document based, personal information spaces" is an inquiry system to explore textual information spaces, supporting the user with the search paradigm "orienteering".
- [lodex](https://git.opendfki.de/reuschling/lodex) - Lodex-Linked Open Data Extraction Tool enables to extract large ontology vocabularies out of unstructured data such as document text or social network messages. It runs as service with freebase and DBPedia vocabularies. You can create own ontologies.
- [GenIe](https://git.opendfki.de/reuschling/genie) - GenIe is a tool for genetic or evolutionary hyperparameter optimization with entropy analysis. It is written in Java, but can be used language independent with config files and fitness function process calls.
- [myCBR](https://git.opendfki.de/mycbr) - An open-source similarity-based Case Based Reasoning retrieval tool and software development kit (also see [myCBR-project.org](http://mycbr-project.org/)).

Older TRAC project can be found on [www.opendfki.de/trac](http://www.opendfki.de/trac/), such as:
- [delight](https://delight.opendfki.de/trac/) - Using XML-RPC the easy way...
